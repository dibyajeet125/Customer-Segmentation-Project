# Customer-Segmentation-Project
The Customer Segmentation Project is an analytical endeavor that employs R programming to categorize customers based on shared characteristics, enhancing marketing strategies and customer engagement. Utilizing key libraries such as dplyr for data manipulation and ggplot2 for visualization, this project explores a dataset containing vital customer demographics and behavioral metrics, including age, gender, annual income, and spending scores.

Data Exploration:
The initial phase involved a thorough examination of the dataset's structure using functions like str(), names(), head(), and summary(). This exploration focused on identifying distributions and patterns in key features. The analysis revealed a balanced gender distribution through bar and pie charts, indicating an unbiased approach to segmentation. The age distribution was assessed using histograms and box plots, highlighting that most customers were younger, with some outliers present. Annual income was analyzed through histograms and density plots, demonstrating a relatively even income spread that allows for diverse segmentation strategies. Additionally, spending score variations were visualized with boxplots and histograms, indicating significant differences in customer engagement levels.

Statistical Summaries:
Statistical summaries provided further insights into the customer profile. The average age and standard deviation framed the typical customer demographic, while annual income analysis outlined the financial spectrum of the customer base. The spending score analysis served as a foundation for segmenting customers based on their engagement levels.

Visualization Techniques:
The project incorporated various visualization techniques to convey insights effectively. Gender distribution was illustrated through both bar charts and pie charts, while age distribution was explored with histograms and box plots. Annual income and spending score analyses utilized density plots and boxplots to highlight variations among customers. These visualizations not only enhanced understanding but also facilitated more informed decision-making regarding marketing strategies.
